trained.model.py is a CNN that is trained to determine if a driver driving a vehicle is distracted.
For the purpose of this project, distraction is defined by any non-driving activities like phone use,
looking outside of windows for a prolonged period of time, reaching down or back for something, and sleeping.
This model has been deemed to be different from competition by implementing the aspect of sleeping. This 
allows it to be significantly more safe for people like truck drivers who often fall asleep at the wheel 
which is often fatal.
